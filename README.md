##   About
###   Features
*   Line graph showing the estimated previous traffic and projected future traffic
*   Header for each cell with:
  *   open/closed status
  *   Estimated number of people at the dining hall
  *   Estimated walking time from your location to the dining hall
*   Number of swipes remaining in upper right corner
*   Warning message telling the user that he/she is low on swipes

###   About this version

This was thrown together over the course of an afternoon/evening. It is not hooked up to any real data currently and this is practically the only page in the application. It's just meant to show that we're serious about developing something.

###   Why?

I guess because we wanted to and now we have the skill sets to actually make it happen. The current app also feels a bit abandoned. We're just students that want to create something for students. 

### Future plans

*   Graph Views
  *   Horizontally scrollable to see past trends for day/month
  *   Labels in background showing time
  *   Aesthetic improvements to help make the difference between future/past more intuitive
  *   Horizontal capacity lines unique to each location that would serve as a reference point to help users better understand what the traffic number means for that location
*   Better photographs for headers
*   Building out the pages for each dining hall
*   Nutrition section
  *   User could enter their age, weight, height, and goal weight and the app would use nutrition data from the dining halls to build a personalized diet plan. 
*   General aesthetics tinkering
